            <Description>
                Dual Power Generation is a Senior Design Project.  Our goal was to turn Solar and Wind into energy.  The group consisted of Electrical and Computer Engineers.  
                As a Computer Engineer, my role was to calculate the Max Power between Solar and Wind and display the information to our end user.
