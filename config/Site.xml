        <Project Topic="Dual Power Generation">
            <Description>
                Dual Power Generation is a Senior Design Project.  Our goal was to turn Solar and Wind into energy.  The group consisted of Electrical and Computer Engineers.  
                As a Computer Engineer, my role was to calculate the Max Power between Solar and Wind and display the information to our end user.

        <Project Topic="Roloflex">
            <Description>
                Being the old fashion person I am, I grab my inspiration from the Rolodex.
                &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                I found that I do not have all my personal information available as easy on some devices.  I do not carry my personal passwords with  me on my phone.  
                Using a Raspberry Pi as my Apache server, Roloflex is similar to this site but for the purpose to host my access to my information, which is stored 
                in a database on the Pi.

        <Project Topic="Site">
            <Description>
                This site is actually a personal project of mine.  Programmed in PHP, this site will serve as a portfolio and supplement to my current resume.  
                My goal is to make this site configurable and can be interchanged with different xml files.  My next goal is to make a web page for my music that mirrors this.

        <Project Topic="FPGAClock">
            <Description>
                The FPGA Clock project is a rebirth of one of my projects in my undergrad.  My FPGA board is just sitting at the side of my bed picking up dust, so might as well 
                make a clock out of it.
